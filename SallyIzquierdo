    <h1>In the Spotlight: Dr. Sally Izquierdo</h1>

    <p>This month, we interviewed Dr. Sally Izquierdo, Director of QC Project Reach and co-developer of the Queens College Neurodiversity Hub,
        to learn more about ways that we can better support neurodivergent students in our classrooms, Universal Design for Learning (UDL), and campus-based resources
        about neurodiversity for faculty and students. <br><br>

        <b>CETLL: Why is it important for QC faculty to consider neurodiversity in their classrooms?</b><br><br>

        <b>Dr. Izquierdo:</b> I think that we have far more neurodivergent students than most of us are aware of.  Diversity in all forms, including neurodiversity, is 
        more the norm than the exception. <br><br>
        
        We are in such a diverse community, and that includes neurodiversity.  It's just one part of broader diversity.  For me, I want faculty to think about neurodiversity
        as part of that broader conversation about diversity--not some little thing on the side. <br><br>

        This isn't about a sprinkling of students with disabilities but recognizing that there are many different forms of neurodiversity that we may identify or may
        not identify.  Students may be registered with the [Office of Special Services] or not.  They may not even have a diagnosis yet. <br><br>

        There are so many different ways students learn.  I want faculty to be more proactive in preparing for any student who walks into their classroom, making their
        environments and courses as inclusive as possible to embrace all those forms of diversity. <br><br>

        <b>CETLL: What are some steps faculty members can take to ensure their pedagogical approaches are inclusive to the neurodivergent students in their classes?</b><br><br>

        <b>Dr. Izquierdo:</b> I think it can be really overwhelming for faculty members to take steps toward being more inclusive.  One way of approaching it 
        is to think about it as one small step and not looking at it as the whole picture and that I have to make sweeping changes to my course. <br><br>

        If they can identify one thing to change in the coming semester--or one thing in each of their courses--and try it, they can give themselves the opportunity
        to reflect on how it went.  They can also get feedback from students and colleagues and take that one step forward. <br><br>

        In conjunction with that, we have been sharing resources.  So, there are more resources than there has ever been for faculty to learn more about
        neurodiversity, inclusivity, and equitable teaching methods in our courses.  Faculty can start taking advantage of these resources. <br><br>

        For example, CUNY offers the online UDL course, which is asynchronous on Brightspace.  Along with that, there's a collaborative--I'm the UDL facilitator
        for Queens Collge--where faculty can take the course at their own pace and then meet with other faculty members and start to build a community of people
        talking about these things. <br><br>

        It doesn't just require us to learn and try something, but I think it requires a fair amount of discussion among faculty members and sort of peer feedback
        about 'How does this work?  What are some of the barriers for us as instructors?  What are some of the barriers for students that we're trying to address 
        and mediate?' and put our heads together and really build that community of support.  <br><br>

        <b>CETLL: Can you tell us about the goals and strategies of the current UDL collaborative project you are leading?</b><br><br>

        <b>Dr. Izquierdo:</b>The UDL Collaborative involves an online course, developed by CUNY, that's open to all CUNY faculty.  The course includes discussion
        boards, which are a fantastic resource for faculty to talk to each other about what they're trying, what's worked, and what challenges they've faced
        and really engage in that conversation after learning about each of the modules. <br><br>
        
        The Collaborative brings campuses together in groups.  On each campus, faculty come together in person or over Zoom in real time to discuss the concepts,
        ask questions, and share ideas. <br><br>

        I'm learning too.  I'm facilitating it, but I'm just there to make sure everyone shows up and has these conversations.  Faculty have great ideas,
        and these discussions help us address challenges, share what makes things easier, and build a community of support. <br><br>

        The collaborative is all about collegial discussion on a really important topic and about trying something new. <br><br>

        <b>CETLL: What are the main goals for facilitating workshops surrounding UDL and Brightspace?</b><br><br>

        <b>Dr. Izquierdo:</b> The main goals here are to have faculty incorporate UDL into their course design.  We recognized that one of the barriers for faculty
        is time, right?  It's time-consuming to try something new.  And to have to revamp your syllabus and make it more inclusive and put it through an accessibility
        checker and make sure that the principles of UDL are incorporated into your course and the content and how you present things and how you assess students. 
        It's a lot of work to do. <br><br>

        And that time-consuming factor, I think, is a real barrier.  But faculty members do also need to set up their Brightspace courses bcause we are in this first
        wave of moving to Brightspace.  So, we recognized that and tried to make a very efficient workshop that addresses both at the same time because there are 
        many components of universal design for learning that can be implemented while you're designing your Brightspace course. <br><br>
        
        The goals of the workshop are twofold, and that is for faculty to learn how to incorporate the principles of UDL into their courses and design their Brightspace
        course environment to be better prepared for the upcoming semester where they're teaching. <br><br>

        They will actually use the course that they're teaching for the spring semester as the context for both learning about UDL and developing.  And sort of
        fleshing out their Brightspace course environment because there are a lot of universal designs for learning principles built right into the learning
        management system. <br><br>

        By doing it together, you really can get, I think, the most efficient use of faculty time and sort of kill two birds with one stone. <br><br>

        <b>CETLL: What does the Neurodiversity Hub offer to faculty at Queens College?  And are there any other resources you would like to share?</b><br><br>

        <b>Dr. Izquierdo:</b> The Neurodiversity Hub came out of faculty presentations that I did two years ago with a couple of neurodiversity support fellows.
        These fellows were graduate students who were interested in neurodiversity.  They developed those presentations to teach faculty a little bit more about
        neurodiversity and autism more specifically.  These presentations focused on what neurodiversity looks like in the classroom, the potential challenges
        faculty may encounter, and strategies for better supporting neurodivergent students. <br><br>

        Because our fellows developed so many resources during the preparation of that two-part presentation, we wanted a place to house all of those resources so,
        we developed the Neurodiversity Hub as a place to house these resources and to add additional ones as they come across our desk.  The hub serves as a 
        learning tool for faculty to understand neurodiversity. <br><br>

        The goal, or intention, was to use the Microsoft Teams platform to house the hub.  This platform also allows faculty members to connect and converse
        with one another.  If you're a member of the Neurodiversity Hub, you can interact with other team members who are also interested in neurodiversity. <br><br>

        We've had a tremendous response to the hub.  I don't think it gets enough attention on a day-to-day basis, but when people discover it, we've had faculty from 
        universities across the country reach out to learn more.  They've asked how they can implement something similar at their universities and have even requested
        guest access to see the resources we've gathered. <br><br>

        In addition to the Neurodiversity Hub, we also developed a student resource hub.  This hub is specifically designed for neurodivergent students to help them
        access campus resources and other information.  It helps students navigate their college careers with greater efficiency and support.  This resource
        is also hosted on the Teams platform. <br><br>
